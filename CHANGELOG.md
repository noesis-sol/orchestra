# Changelog

All notable changes to orchestra are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- The dashboard's totals no longer show the worker's Herdr tab ID. The tab is
  labelled with the ticket ID in Herdr, and the ID stays in the log and the
  run report.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-29

First release: a Go rewrite of `orchestrate.sh`, which works through a Beads
backlog one ticket at a time, one coding agent per Herdr tab and git worktree.

### Added

- The orchestration loop from `orchestrate.sh`, with the same environment
  variables, log file (`.claude/orchestrate.log`) and exit codes. Every
  setting is also a flag; `-h` lists them and `-version` prints the version.
- A Bubble Tea dashboard, updated in place: the run's totals, a table of its
  tickets (picked up with their title, completed with only their merged
  commit, deferred with the reason), and the active ticket with the worker's
  status, elapsed time and latest action. It stays on screen as the run's
  summary. Colours are exact, so terminal themes can't remap them. Plain log
  lines when not on a terminal, or with `-plain`.
- Organs: LLM-powered steps that run `claude -p` with no tools and no MCP
  servers, on evidence the orchestrator gathers, and only advise.
  - Triage: each deferred ticket gets a cause (environment, instructions or
    problem) and a recommendation in its notes.
  - Reviewer: when the loop stops, a short report (Finished / Set aside /
    Needs you), shown and saved to `.claude/orchestrate-reports/`.
  - `-triage`, `-review` and `-organ-model` (`TRIAGE`, `REVIEW`, `ORGAN_MODEL`).

### Fixed (compared with orchestrate.sh)

- A worker whose prompt was pasted but never submitted is no longer taken
  for finished and deferred untouched: the orchestrator checks the worker
  started, presses Enter if the prompt is waiting in its input box, or sends
  it again if the box is empty. Otherwise it defers the ticket as
  `PROMPT_FAILED`.
- If `herdr agent start` reports a failure but the agent comes up, it is
  used instead of retrying into the occupied pane (`START_FAILED`).
- Screens of busy workers are read from the visible screen, since Herdr
  can't capture a working agent's scrollback.
- `python3` is no longer needed.
